# Unexpected Behavior with Falsy Values in JavaScript Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in a JavaScript function that adds two numbers. The function correctly handles null values, but it doesn't explicitly address other falsy values, which can lead to unexpected results.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function adds two numbers.  It correctly returns `null` if either input is `null`. However, it doesn't handle other falsy values (0, false, "") explicitly. This might lead to unexpected results in scenarios where these values are passed as input.

## Solution

The solution improves the function to explicitly check for all falsy values and handle them appropriately (returning an error or 0).
